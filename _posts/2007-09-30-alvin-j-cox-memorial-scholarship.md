This weekend I submitted three scholarship applications totaling about $12,000; the third of these was the [Alvin J. Cox Memorial Scholarship](http://www.alvincoxmemorial.com/).  Applicants were allowed to pick their own topic, and no word limits.  This essay is a little more free-form, but it roughly about my enjoyment of science and technology.  [Alvin J.
