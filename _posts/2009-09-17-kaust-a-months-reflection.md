  content: "Hey there, Dan. \r\nI was Googling students' experiences in KAUST and
    found myself here. Nice blog btw! \r\n\r\nSo, how's KAUST been working out for
    you, so far?\r\nI've received recent graduate school admissions from North America,
    and now KAUST, and currently trying to weigh the pros and cons for each. I thought
    it'd be interesting hearing it from someone on-board.. :-)   This post doesn't
    sound very encouraging, but how's your current reflection, though?"

    Perhaps this is not the best time to reply - I'm away from KAUST for a week and enjoying the US right now.  That might color my thoughts on the subject.

    It's not horrible.  There are a lot of things going for it that may take effect in the next couple of years.  Currently, we are very happy that the breach is now open six days a week, but only during the day.  And we now have an operational movie theater that is open two nights per week.

    That said, depending on your department, you may have access to state of the art equipment now, or you may not for quite a long time.  Computer science and applied mathematics programs have good access to equipment (especially in visualization and high-performance computing).  Most other departments are not so lucky - marine scientists lack much of even the most basic gear, and other majors don't have labs yet.

    For all its flaws, I've started to make it my home, and the people are generally pretty fantastic.

  content: "Too bad I can't subscribe to comments on your blog, I didn't know you
    replied. Thanks a lot for the reply!\r\n\r\nI've been accepted in Computer Science
    actually, but still haven't confirmed my admission. Still confused. It's good
    to know that the high-tech equipment are well-utilized and functioning properly!
    High-performance computing sound very interesting. I remember going through a
    great hassle during one of my research experiments, trying to execute a highly
    complex graph-theory algorithm that took days on the most powerful computers I
    could get access to here where I live. Would be cool having access to a great
    super computer like the one in KAUST.  It's also good to hear that you're pleased
    with the people you're dealing with.\r\n\r\nYour two cents are going to be very
    helpful for me! Thanks again. I'll be keeping an eye on this cool blog of yours.
    \ Do tell more about KAUST when you're in the mood for it ; )"

One month ago, I stepped onto Saudi Arabian soil for what I anticipated to be a magical experience coming to KAUST. Well, yes and no.

For our first three weeks here, 350+ students were stowed in a hotel. Granted, the Intercontinental is a nice hotel but they told us that they'd be bringing us here early so that we might get settled - buy the things like blenders and speakers that we needed, and work the kinks out of our newly minted apartments. We did take care of things like applying for iqamas (our residency permits), but outside of that, we were by and large sitting around.

One event they put on for us that I know I enjoyed was they managed to take 100 students into the desert to go four-wheeling.  That was actually pretty awesome.

Five days of orientation beginning the last days of August, largely filled with cultural sensitivity issues and massively behind schedule.  There seems to be some cultural disagreement about punctuality, but with no exaggeration, one of these mornings the _opening_ presentations scheduled for 8 am did not get under way until 10.  And when you tack on an hour-and-a-half commute from the hotel to the campus, you get a bunch of tired students who would much rather be elsewhere. As a final `can't believe it's so' moment, it was all scheduled during Ramadan - so students who were fasting and who would otherwise be sleeping had to be awake and active.

Getting to campus was another ordeal. We were all very excited to move in, and then largely disappointed to find everything from rodents to black mold, leaky pipes to bottled `leavings' of construction workers. A few days later, ceilings began to collapse in some units.

At this point, school had started, of course. Like many others, for the first few days of class I was sleeping on a friend's couch.  When I and about a dozen other students were scheduled to move in (getting up at 7:30 to come to campus in time), we were told that it would be about an hour until we could be given keys and move in, but ended up waiting 7 hours to be told that there was no way we would be able to move in, and had to go back to Jeddah.

Books for most classes have still not arrived. We haven't any clusters online for high-performance computing. In some disciplines, labs won't be online until 2010. The second fastest supercomputer in academia sits dormant in the basement of one of our buildings because the data center is not clean.

I would like to make it clear that I understand that anything this big getting off the ground so quickly is bound to have problems. There were going to be wrinkles (if not kinks) to work out, and I can appreciate that. I hope to not descend into a rant as frankly I'm all ranted out.

There have been perks - the food on campus is free to students for an indeterminate amount of time; our books will be purchased for us this semester; there have been goodies abundant to be had (from t-shirts to thumb-drives).  As much as I love a thumb drive, I would have preferred something else - a home.

That said, the students have mobilized. We've signed petitions, we've organized, and we've gotten interim student representation in place. We wanted to convey the idea that we don't want to perpetually complain but would like to help out if that means us coming into a better situation. And despite some of our expectations, within two days, the administration had contacted us to schedule meetings and put us in contact with the contractors in charge of this and that (IT, housing, etc.).  It's actually been very inspiring to see the actions we take have tangible results. Had to talked to me two days ago, you would have found me a very tired and disenchanted man, but today I'm very hopeful.

In terms of academics, I am really happy with the faculty. I've secured a TA position, and I spend a couple hours a day with this prof in a constant stream of geeking out. And I spoke yesterday to a prof for two hours about the research he's doing and how I might get involved on that front. Depending on how this goes, I'd be willing to consider staying on for a PhD!

I've made instant friends with a couple of students here, and three of us have gotten a license to host a local TED event: TEDxKAUST.  We'll replay some of our favorite talks, and those we think would be most inspiring to students here, and we hope to get a couple of professors to present as well. In our budget, we've been able to allocate funds to booths and demos and if all goes well (read: gets approved), we'll have a [Ruben's Tube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpCquUWqaYw).
