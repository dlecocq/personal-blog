<p>Yes, yes(1) is built-in to Mac and Linux (at least OS X Lion and Ubuntu 11.04). And, as you might guess, it repeatedly prints a string of your choice ('y' by default) followed by a newline to stdout. Its sole purpose in life is to automate agreeing to prompts. I encountered it recently in a script that was automating RAID array deployment on EC2 ephemeral disks:<br />
<code><br />
# mdadm doesn't let you automate by default, so pipe in 'y'!<br />
yes | mdadm ...<br />
<&#47;code></p>
