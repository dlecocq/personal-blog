<p>NPAR (Non-Photorealistic Animation and Rendering) 2009 finished wrapped today and I found it entirely compelling.  Stunning keynotes from Disney&#47;Pixar and Ubisoft reminded me of why I'm so interested in graphics - pretty pictures.</p>
<p>Going into this, I had anticipated that I would be far out-shined by the presenters and papers, but now more than ever I feel as though I can really compete with these guys.</p>
<p>I'm still sort of shopping for a thesis, and there are a million ideas I've come across here to develop.  I'm keeping a list of techniques I'd like to apply to these problems and a list of projects and things to implement hopefully in a weekend.  A non-exhaustive list would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>feature lines in raytracing<&#47;li>
<li>stippling<&#47;li>
<li>perfect tiling of patterns on arbitrary meshes<&#47;li>
<li>exploring space-filling curves<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<p>Thank you to all the presenters and keynote speakers - you were all fantastic.  And thanks to all the planners and sponsors of the conference.</p>
