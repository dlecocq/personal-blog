<p>This weekend I submitted three scholarship applications totaling about $12,000; the third of these was the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.alvincoxmemorial.com&#47;">Alvin J. Cox Memorial Scholarship<&#47;a>.  Applicants were allowed to pick their own topic, and no word limits.  This essay is a little more free-form, but it roughly about my enjoyment of science and technology.  <a href='http:&#47;&#47;dan.lecocq.us&#47;wordpress&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2007&#47;09&#47;essay.pdf' title='Alvin J. Cox Memorial Scholarship Essay'>Alvin J. Cox Memorial Scholarship Essay<&#47;a>.</p>
