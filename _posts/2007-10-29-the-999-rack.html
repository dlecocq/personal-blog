<p>At the supermarket, middle-aged folks with nothing planned for the evening will take a glance at the $9.99 rack of movies just to see if anything pops out at them.  Middle-aged folks.</p>
<p>More and more the movies that are on those racks are some of my favorites: Trainspotting, Am&eacute;lie, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown...  So, when did I become the target market?  In some ways it's nice that products I want are being marketed towards me, or rather that there's more of a market for things that I want, but I still find it quietly discouraging.</p>
