  content: "Dan,\r\n\r\nI just wrote a comment on http:&#47;&#47;news.ycombinator.com&#47;item?id=3683014
    then tracked you down and realized you're in Seattle. Small world, so, what's
    up with Shovel? What didn't you like about Fabric? Maybe write something on that
    page. I use Fabric every day, see.\r\n\r\nToby, Poulsbo (near Bainbridge Island)

<p>I began work almost a month ago at a Seattle company, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.seomoz.org&#47;" title="SEOmoz" target="_blank">SEOmoz<&#47;a>. Interesting projects, talented people, and a good place to be. Today I posted my first contribution to their <a href="http:&#47;&#47;devblog.seomoz.org&#47;" title="Dev Blog" target="_blank">Dev Blog<&#47;a> talking about <a href="http:&#47;&#47;devblog.seomoz.org&#47;2011&#47;08&#47;launching-and-deploying-instances-with-boto-and-fabric&#47;" title="Launching and Deploying Instances with Boto and Fabric" target="_blank">scripting the launching  and deployment of EC2 instances with boto and frabric<&#47;a>.</p>
