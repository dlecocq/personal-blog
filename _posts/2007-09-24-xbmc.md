My XBox is now my gateway to my media.  $4.73 for Splinter Cell (how this particular hack gets the Linux installer running), and $21.81 for an Action Replay kit to transfer the files. Now, all the media on the LAN are at the fingertips of my XBox.  Music, Pictures, Movies and TV Shows - the whole gambit.

I used [this Lifehacker article](http://lifehacker.com/software/geek-to-live/transform-your-classic-xbox-into-a-killer-media-center-299809.php) as a guideline.  All in all, it took about an hour.
