Several days ago, Gizmodo posted a quiz about [technology addiction](http://gizmodo.com/5453262/quiz-are-you-addicted-to-technology).  Somewhat nervously / reluctantly looked through the questions, and was pleased to find that I fit into their "Coffee Fiend" category.  Well, rather, I was pleased that I didn't fall in any of their worse categories, despite working with computers for a living.  There are even some places I could do with shaving down that would get me into their "Social Drinker" category; I see this as proof that one still can be in a tech field and not be a total tech fiend.

Some of their more amusing / revealing / interesting questions were:

> Do you sometimes bring your laptop when you sit on the toilet?

Just for the record, I do not.  But, I know people who do, and let's face it - that's why the iPhone was invented in the first place.

> Have you ever changed vacation plans based on wi-fi availability?

Well, technically yes, I have done that.  But it was deciding between two capsule hotels, and I was going to be there for a week for a tech conference.  I think that's justified.

> If your house were on fire, would you run in to rescue your laptop?

I have sort of done this already.  Fire alarms are a regular feature of KAUST, and one day we saw smoke coming from the building we were in as one went off.  Ben and I looked at each other for 2 or 3 seconds, then both immediately grabbed our laptops and dashed out.  In all fairness, most of my work is on there (I'm doing more off-site backups for the important stuff), and it's the only computer I have in this country.  What is life without computer?

> Do you tweet or read blogs while watching movies at home?

Well, I do play Tetris.  That's my tech meditation time.
