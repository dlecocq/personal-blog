I've failed before, at many things, and it is a habit I can't seem to break.  It's inevitable that things won't work (especially not the first time) and in fact programmers know that it's a beautiful thing when code compiles the first time, let alone works correctly the first time.

With graphics, the results are sometimes cool, sometimes horrifying and sometimes beautiful.  I make a habit of documenting the results of broken code as much as I can, and after a recent one, I thought I'd share some of the more interesting ones.
