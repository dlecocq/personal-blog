I met with my professor this week, and he said that my project seemed good.  I have been working on it for a couple months now, and needed his approval in order to complete it, so I'm glad to have gotten it.  There's still a lot more to be done, and I have to give a couple of brief presentations (one, I think has to be 日本語で, but I'm not entirely certain).  There's also an abstract we're supposed to write when all is said and done, but it's trivial.

Japanese test tomorrow.  Yesterday I started working my way through the 573 words we are supposed to know.  I still have 170 left, and it's 1 pm, day before.  I'll have the vocab under control by then, but I still have to worry about the grammar portion.
