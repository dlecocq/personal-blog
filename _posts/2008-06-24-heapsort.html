<p>I was reading about <a href="http:&#47;&#47;groups.google.com&#47;group&#47;algogeeks">Algorithm Geeks<&#47;a>, a Google Group dedicated to algorithm-related questions apparently.  I looked at one of the topics, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;groups.google.com&#47;group&#47;algogeeks&#47;web&#47;unique-elements-in-an-array">Unique Elements in an Array<&#47;a>, wondering what the chatter looked like.</p>
<p>To remove duplicate elements of an array, the best way I know is to sort your array, and then do a linear traversal, comparing each to its successor, and when they match, deleting the one of them.  Quicksort is generally the algorithm-of-choice in large part because of its simplicity, but someone on this thread suggested <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Heapsort">heapsort<&#47;a> - an algorithm of which I had never heard.  I looked it over, and was drawn to the article on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Binary_heap">heaps<&#47;a>.  On that page, I was looking at an analysis of the time complexity for building the heap, and I got curious about the summation they present (h&#47;2^h).  So, I took some time and proved its convergence:</p>
