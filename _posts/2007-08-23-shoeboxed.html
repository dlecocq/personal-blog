<p>I read about <a href="http:&#47;&#47;shoeboxed.com">Shoeboxed<&#47;a> today on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;lifehacker.com&#47;software&#47;shopping&#47;organize-your-receipts-at-shoeboxedcom-291543.php">Lifehacker<&#47;a>, and have been trying it out.  Up until this point, I really do keep physical receipts in a shoebox or binder (and probably still will) and have been tagging e-mailed receipts as such in Gmail, and then archiving them.  That was all fine and dandy, but it's nice to have something that's built just for that.  I took all my old Gmail-stored receipts from such various places as Basegear.com and Potion Factory, and it recognized them as receipts without a hitch and found the right amount in the e-mail.  Well-done Shoeboxed.</p>
<p>It reminds me of a service called <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.keyfiler.com&#47;">KeyFiler<&#47;a> which lets you store your registration keys for software, etc. in a safe, secure and accessible place.</p>
