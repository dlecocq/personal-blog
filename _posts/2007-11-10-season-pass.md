Thanks to Wells Fargo's promotion whereby opening a "College Combo" account with them gives the customer a voucher for 2 season passes for the price of one, I got my first season pass.  I didn't know anyone who would want a pass, and so I put an ad on Facebook and found someone almost immediately, and yesterday we went down to Christy Sports and bought our passes.  I look forward to my first season in Colorado - if you want to go to Copper Mountain, Winter Park or Mary Jane, give me an email!
