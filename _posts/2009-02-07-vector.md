Had a bizarre C.S. / kitten related dream.  Apparently I was giving way kittens, and I wanted to make sure I had one left for myself, and so I thought it would be a good idea to declare a standard template library vector of kittens, fill it with my kittens, and only give away more kittens while there was still more than one left:

```c++
vector<kitten> kitties;

# Put kittens in vector
# ...

while(kitties.length() > 1) {
  give_away(kitties.pop());
}
```
