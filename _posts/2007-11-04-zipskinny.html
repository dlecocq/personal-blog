  content: Dan, you have no fucking idea. Come spend a week here in Fannin County,
    Georgia. No one here appreciates my witty bon mots or my taste in Indy Rock, and
    everyone thinks Coors Light is great beer. If you want to get a feel for it try
    using no more than two hundred different words in a given week. I think Kara's
    Mom is the only person in a fifty mile radius with a Masters Degree. Our neighbor
    have John Deere dishes, curtains, pillow shams and stocking caps, but don't own
    a John Deere tractor or mower. This is not some ironic cool bullshit. This is
    just the style of decor that is popular and appropriate. Consider yourself blessed
    to live in as wonderfully educated a place as you do. Lord knows I wish Icould
    move back.

  content: One other thing, 30559 is even whiter than Boulder. And Boulder is the
    place that made me hate white people.

  content: "I can only imagine.  The ZipSkinny stats for 30559 look pretty glum -
    low education, very married, and so very white.  Frederick has a high rate of
    married people, so it's interesting to look at Boulder where about a third to
    a half are divorced or never been married.\r\n\r\nThe mothership calls you back
    to Boulder."

<p>I read about <a href="http:&#47;&#47;zipskinny.com">ZipSkinny.com<&#47;a> on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;lifehacker.com&#47;software&#47;community&#47;get-city-information-with-zipskinny-318343.php">Lifehacker<&#47;a> a couple of days ago, and it's actually pretty neat.  I never knew how white, educated, upper-middle-class middle-aged parent-like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;zipskinny.com&#47;index.php?zip=80504&x=0&y=0">my community<&#47;a> was.  How did it escape my attention?</p>
<p>Still, I do get a certain amount of pride from the education level of Colorado, and especially the Boulder area.  Culture is just dripping from every hemp messenger bag and Birkenstock sandal in Boulder proper.</p>
