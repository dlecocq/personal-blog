<p>Like MacGy-ay-ay-ay-ver.</p>
<p>Scenario: you need to boil some water to incapacitate a guard (a hot cup of tea puts him right to sleep.  Also, he's very trusting when it comes to strangers offering him tea), and you've got sandpaper, two soda cans, a razor, a tuft of fiberglass insulation, a tack and a bottle of Heet at your disposal.  Also, the internet to watch <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.metacafe.com&#47;watch&#47;839102&#47;cool_little_miniature_stove&#47;">this metacafe<&#47;a> video.</p>
<p><a href='http:&#47;&#47;dan.lecocq.us&#47;wordpress&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2007&#47;10&#47;macgyver-stove.png' title='MacGyver Stove'><img style="float:left;margin:5px" src='http:&#47;&#47;dan.lecocq.us&#47;wordpress&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2007&#47;10&#47;macgyver-stove.thumbnail.png' alt='MacGyver Stove' &#47;><&#47;a>I had seen this before and in various design complexities, but I really like the compactness and ease of this one.  I decided to scrounge up some Heet ($2.10 at a local gas station), a couple of cans, sandpaper and a razor blade (both on hand), and pull a little piece of insulation off of some that happened to be sitting in our basement.</p>
<p>It got surprisingly hot - I tried setting an oven rack over it with a kettle (to knock out that tea-loving guard), and it started to melt one of the bars of the rack.  I expected it to be hot, but not hot enough to melt parts of an oven rack.  Who knew?</p>
<p>Success: certainly.</p>
