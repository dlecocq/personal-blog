<p>For various reasons, two weeks ago, I feel a week behind in schoolwork.  I have worked harder than I've ever worked for school, caught up, and I'm now almost finished with finals - just one more to go.  A couple days after that, I'll be starting my internship at ReadyTalk, and so the summer is starting to kick off more or less.</p>
<p>The 15th sees my friends and me moving into a place for a summer that promises to be filled with hanging out, organically grown food (Alan works on an organic farm), and wine.</p>
