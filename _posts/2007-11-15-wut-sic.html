<p>My first <a href="http:&#47;&#47;woot.com">woot<&#47;a> is just 25 miles away.  I've been keeping my ear to the ground with their RSS feed for the last year or so (and seen a few woot-worthy - though, unfortunately they only ship to the States), but this is my first wooting.  What is my first woot?  A toy I don't need, but I hope to have fun with - <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.roboquadonline.com&#47;">Roboquad<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>Take a look at some of the videos you can find <a href="http:&#47;&#47;youtube.com&#47;results?search_query=roboquad&search=Search">around<&#47;a> the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;video.google.com&#47;videosearch?q=roboquad">interwebs<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, within a week, I've made my second wooting - this time a Roomba Discovery for my parents for Christmas.  Shh - don't tell them.</p>
<p><strong>Update:<&#47;strong> My woot is on my doorstep. (<strong>10:08 11&#47;16&#47;07<&#47;strong>)</p>
