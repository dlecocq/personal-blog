<p>Had a bizarre C.S. &#47; kitten related dream.  Apparently I was giving way kittens, and I wanted to make sure I had one left for myself, and so I thought it would be a good idea to declare a standard template library vector of kittens, fill it with my kittens, and only give away more kittens while there was still more than one left:</p>
<pre lang='cpp'>
vector<kitten> kitties;</p>
<p># Put kittens in vector<br />
# ...</p>
<p>while(kitties.length() > 1) {<br />
	give_away(kitties.pop());<br />
}<br />
<&#47;pre></p>
