<p>Several days ago, Gizmodo posted a quiz about <a href="http:&#47;&#47;gizmodo.com&#47;5453262&#47;quiz-are-you-addicted-to-technology">technology addiction<&#47;a>.  Somewhat nervously &#47; reluctantly looked through the questions, and was pleased to find that I fit into their "Coffee Fiend" category.  Well, rather, I was pleased that I didn't fall in any of their worse categories, despite working with computers for a living.  There are even some places I could do with shaving down that would get me into their "Social Drinker" category; I see this as proof that one still can be in a tech field and not be a total tech fiend.</p>
<p>Some of their more amusing &#47; revealing &#47; interesting questions were:</p>
<blockquote><p>
2. Do you sometimes bring your laptop when you sit on the toilet?<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>Just for the record, I do not.  But, I know people who do, and let's face it - that's why the iPhone was invented in the first place.</p>
<blockquote><p>
8. Have you ever changed vacation plans based on wi-fi availability?<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>Well, technically yes, I have done that.  But it was deciding between two capsule hotels, and I was going to be there for a week for a tech conference.  I think that's justified.</p>
<blockquote><p>
10. If your house were on fire, would you run in to rescue your laptop?<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>I have sort of done this already.  Fire alarms are a regular feature of KAUST, and one day we saw smoke coming from the building we were in as one went off.  Ben and I looked at each other for 2 or 3 seconds, then both immediately grabbed our laptops and dashed out.  In all fairness, most of my work is on there (I'm doing more off-site backups for the important stuff), and it's the only computer I have in this country.  What is life without computer?</p>
<blockquote><p>
35. Do you tweet or read blogs while watching movies at home?<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>Well, I do play Tetris.  That's my tech meditation time.</p>
