I broke down, and I bought one.  I'm now one of those a**holes walking down the street checking his email.  I want to stay connected, via email and the internet, and also a phone.

See, for what has now become a multi-year bother, my friends have been pestering me about getting a cell phone.  I put it off citing the associated charges and the shortcomings of other phones.  But now, I can do a lot of tedious tasks I used to use my laptop for - checking mail, calling people, reading news, find local movie show times, get directions from point me to point b.  Even listen to my music and watch stupid internet videos.

Simultaneously a great and sad day.
