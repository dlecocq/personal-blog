This has been the first week back to school after break.  Interestingly enough, there's only about three weeks left until we get back to break, this time for two months.  What does that break hold?  Who knows.

Things that will happen for certain: snow festival and snowboarding. 

Every year in Sapporo, they have a snow festival that lasts for like six days. Colin and others and I are planning to go, maybe be by train.  My hope, however, is that we go by boat.  Freezing waters of Japan?  Hell yeah.

As far as snowboarding goes, mostly a matter of when friends want to go.  A lot of Colin, Keith, Zhou Peng, Nicolas, and we might even invite New York's own John from down the hall.

In preparation, I went out and bought グロブs (we call them gloves) from Mont Bell downtown.  They are by far the nicest and most expensive gloves I've ever bought in my life, but man, are they comfortable.  I'm looking forward to hitting the slopes (maybe this weekend), just to wear them.
