<p>For a recent project, we were looking for an issue tracker. Our biggest criteria was something that was free -- we weren't planning on doing anything complicated, and so available issue trackers were essentially equal in our eyes. We ended up going with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;unfuddle.com&#47;">Unfuddle<&#47;a>, but it wasn't until after signing up that we discovered its biggest strength: an API.</p>
<p>There are other issue trackers with an API, but this one seemed reasonable enough so we used it. The big get for us in building a web-based app, is that it <strong>lowers the barrier for reporting bugs<&#47;strong>. We set up our development server to include a bug-reporting button that collected a little report that then sent it to our server, which uses the Unfuddle API to add a ticket. It also records and submits a little information about the user's browser, current session, etc. that might help in debugging their problem.</p>
<p>Not the most complicated or profound system in the world, but it does put user-reported (and tester-reported) bugs in the same place we check our to-dos and other issues. No checking a support email account we remember once a month. Just puts bugs right were we're looking anyway. I hope to share a little bit of the backend code soon!</p>
