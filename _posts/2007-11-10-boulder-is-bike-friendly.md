Boulder is its own kind of place.  That's not to say I don't like it - there are certainly things to like about it, but its high pedestrian and bicyclist population makes me paranoid whenever I drive there.

By all means pedestrians should have the right of way in city limits on the road, but people in Boulder tend to bolt out onto the street with complete disregard for traffic.  Ack.

At any rate, I was reading on Wired about Virgin rating the [11 most bike-friendly cities in the world](http://blog.wired.com/cars/2007/11/where-are-the-m.html), and I felt a hint of a tinge of pride at the fact that Boulder, CO appeared fourth on the list.  Go hippies.
