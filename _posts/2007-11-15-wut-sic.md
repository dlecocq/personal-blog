My first [woot](http://woot.com) is just 25 miles away.  I've been keeping my ear to the ground with their RSS feed for the last year or so (and seen a few woot-worthy - though, unfortunately they only ship to the States), but this is my first wooting.  What is my first woot?  A toy I don't need, but I hope to have fun with - [Roboquad](http://www.roboquadonline.com/).

Take a look at some of the videos you can find [around](http://youtube.com/results?search_query=roboquad&search=Search) the [interwebs](http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=roboquad).

Incidentally, within a week, I've made my second wooting - this time a Roomba Discovery for my parents for Christmas.  Shh - don't tell them.

__Update:__ My woot is on my doorstep. (__10:08 11/16/07__)
