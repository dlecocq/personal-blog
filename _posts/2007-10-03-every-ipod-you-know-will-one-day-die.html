<p>The folks over at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ipodmechanic.com&#47;">iPod Mechanic<&#47;a> have conjured up the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ipodmechanic.com&#47;deathclock&#47;index.php">iPod Deathclock<&#47;a> which, given your iPod's serial number and a little information on how you use it, it tried to predict when your little friend will expire.  </p>
<p>According to them, my 1st-gen iPod video has got another 483 days, 5 hours, 7 minutes and change left.  Not bad in my opinion - I've already had it for a year+ and I use it for a couple of hours every day.</p>
<p>My 2nd-gen iPod shuffle has got 513 days, 15 hours, 33 minutes of tunes for the trails before it kicks it.  I've had it for about 11 months, and have enjoyed it intensely - relatively cheap (especially for Apple), aesthetically pleasing, and I love the clip.  Yeah, it's not for everyone or everything, but autofill it from a 'haven't-heard-this-in-a-while' playlist (using smart playlists and the last-played date), and it's a little nostalgia machine.  It also helps me resurface the 'why-do-I-even-have-this-album' music and get rid of it.</p>
<p>As per their suggestion on the site, I'm going to add a reminder on the day it's set to die, and we'll see if they're still ticking away.</p>
