<p>Python has a pretty useful policy: named arguments. When you call a function, you can explicitly say that such-and-such value is what you're providing for a particular argument, and can even include them in any order:</p>
<pre lang='python'>
def hello(first, last):<br />
	print 'Hello %s %s' % (first, last)</p>
<p>hello(last='Lecocq', first='Dan')<br />
<&#47;pre></p>
<p>In fact, you can programmatically gain insight into functions with the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;docs.python.org&#47;library&#47;inspect.html" title="inspect" target="_blank">inspect module<&#47;a>. But suppose you want to be able to accept an arbitrary number of parameters. For example, for a printf equivalent. Or where I encountered it in wanting to read a module name from a configuration file, as well as the arguments to instantiate it. In this case, you'd get the module and class as a string and then a dictionary of the arguments to make an instance of it. Of course, Python always has a way. In this case, **kwargs.</p>
<p>This is actually dictionary unpacking, taking all the keys in a dictionary and mapping them to argument names. For example, in the above example, I could say:</p>
<pre lang='python'>
hello(**{'last':'Lecocq', 'first':'Dan'})<br />
<&#47;pre></p>
<p>Of course, in that case it's a little verbose, but if you're getting a dictionary of arguments programmatically, then it's invaluable. But wait, there's more! Not only can you use the **dict operator to map a dictionary into parameters, but you can accept arbitrary parameters with it, too!</p>
<pre lang='python'>
def kw(**kwargs):<br />
	for key, value in kwargs.items():<br />
		print '%s => %s' % (key, value)</p>
<p>kw(**{'hello':'Howdy!', 'first':'Dan'})<br />
kw(hello='Howdy!', first='Dan')<br />
<&#47;pre></p>
<p>Magic! <strong>No matter how you invoke the function, it has access to the parameters.<&#47;strong>  You can even split the difference, making some parameters named and some parameters variable. For example, if you wanted to create an instance of a class that you passed a name in for, initialized with the arguments you give it:</p>
<pre lang='python'>
def factory(module, cls, **kwargs):<br />
	# The built-in __import__ does just what it sounds like<br />
	m = __import__(module)<br />
	# Now get the class in that module<br />
	c = getattr(m, cls)<br />
	# Now make an instance of it, given the args<br />
	return c(**kwargs)</p>
<p>factory('datetime', 'datetime', year=2011, month=11, day=8)<br />
factory('decimal', 'Decimal', value=7)<br />
<&#47;pre></p>
<p>This is one place where Python's flexibility is extremely useful.</p>
