I am actually writing this post from my Nintendo DS.  Though I originally got the DS to use with a Kanji dictionary cartridge, since I had it laying around, I thought I'd drop the $30 to let me surf the net with it.  That said, I had heard mixed reviews about the Opera web browser for DS, but most complaints were from people looking to play Flash games on the 'net or people expecting Firefox on something like this.

Although it doesn't boast the fastest browsing around, I'm liking it very much so far.  Late nights in bed trying to recall the details of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm can be settled earlier with a bedside visit to Wikipedia from my new toy.  I envision myself taking this places where I don't want to lug around a laptop (read: coffee shops), but I may have to look something up on Google or Wikipedia to verify a friendly bet.

It is, however, a little cumbersome to write a post or e-mail like this.

Addendum:

I thought it might be useful to show some sites with which I've had success, and which ones flounder.

- Facebook - yes; little finnicky
- Gmail - yes; no hitches
- Google Reader - not yet; trying to tweak
- Meebo - no; definite no
- Lifehacker - yes; looks good, too
- Wired - yes; slow to open, though
- Google Search - yes
- Google Maps - no :-(
- Instructables - no
- Yahoo Maps - yes; I miss Google
