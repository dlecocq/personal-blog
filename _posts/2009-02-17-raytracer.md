Last semester for Graphics, we each wrote raytracers, and this semester for Graphics II, we've been asked to add more advanced features to them.

I had written mine in Ruby for its short development cycle, but raytracers aren't the most efficient renderers on the planet, and it would take hours to run on a single input on occasion.  So, not wanting to deal with that this semester, I rewrote it in C++.  Much faster.  The most difficult input (same set) now takes about a minute.  I finished it up today, and here are some pretty pictures to sate you:
