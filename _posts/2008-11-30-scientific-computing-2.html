<p>A couple of weeks ago now, I spoke to a professor about the possibility of T.A.'ing next semester's CSCI407 - Scientific Computing.  It was one of my favorite classes at Mines, and I'm really looking forward to it.  The professor will not be on campus from March onward, and so it will be an online class from that point, but I'll likely be holding regular class hours during that time.  Exciting!</p>
<p>This is all because one of my few regrets about KAUST is that I wouldn't get a chance to T.A. or teach there as a student, so, I'm pursuing that here.</p>
<p>So, if you've still got Sci. Comp. left to take, take it next semester.  I hear they're going to have a sweet T.A.!</p>
