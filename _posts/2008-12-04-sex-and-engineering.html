<p>There's a guy who's perpetually in alamode (the lab of choice for the C.S. major of discerning taste) named Feineman.  It was through him that I found <a href="http:&#47;&#47;failblog.org&#47;">failblog<&#47;a> - he was tearing through the archive and it had some pretty funny stuff.</p>
<p>Yesterday he found yet another gem.  Apparently there's a mutex (mutual exclusion) on sex and studying engineering:</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="400" caption="It&#39;s my future! I want to be an engineer... sex can wait!"]<a href="http:&#47;&#47;secretgeek.net&#47;image&#47;future.jpg"><img alt="Its my future! I want to be an engineer... sex can wait!" src="http:&#47;&#47;secretgeek.net&#47;image&#47;future.jpg" title="Sex Can Wait!" width="400"&#47;><&#47;a>[&#47;caption]</p>
