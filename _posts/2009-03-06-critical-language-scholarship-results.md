  content: "Hi Dan,\r\n\r\nYou have probably put this whole Critical Language Scholarship
    behind you and moved on.  However, if you don't mind me asking, why do you think
    you were not picked?  I read your essay, and it was superbly written.  You seem
    to have so much cultural experience and be the right candidate for such a program.
    \ \r\n\r\nI'm planning to apply to the 2012 group for Arabic."

I was notified today that I was not accepted into the CLS program for Intermediate Arabic.  While I am disappointed and frankly a little surprised, it is a competitive scholarship with acceptance rates under 10%.

To those of you who were accepted, congratulations.
