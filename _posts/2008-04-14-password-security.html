<p>One of my favorite things is when websites show me this when I register:</p>
<p><a href='http:&#47;&#47;dan.lecocq.us&#47;wordpress&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2008&#47;04&#47;picture-3.png' title='I hate security'><img src='http:&#47;&#47;dan.lecocq.us&#47;wordpress&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2008&#47;04&#47;picture-3.png' alt='I hate security' &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>It's almost as if they're saying - "we hate strong passwords."  And it makes me trust even more that they're actually hashing it in their database.</p>
