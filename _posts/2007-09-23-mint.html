<p>I have been dying to try out <a href="http:&#47;&#47;mint.com">Mint<&#47;a>, but unfortunately it doesn't support my local bank at this point.  They recently reworked their setup so that it's much faster than it was a couple of days ago, and it looks so incredibly amazing.  What it does is it keeps track of your various credit cards and bank accounts by logging you in and retrieving your recent activity.  I'm not sure to what extent it automatically sort things, but my understanding is that it will do its best to pick out things like gas and groceries and sort them accordingly.  See the changes in your monthly entertainment spending.  </p>
<p>All in all, it looks very sharp.  I emailed them about adding support for my bank, and hopefully they will do so soon.</p>
