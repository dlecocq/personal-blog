It took me about three hours, but I got my fourth graphics project pretty much done.  A little polish in terms of user interface, and one little feature, but that's it.

The project is dealing with [Voronoi diagrams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi), and so the first part was to generate a random set of points, and then the associated Voronoi diagram:

The next step was to actually create a mosaic.  The idea is that the whole Voronoi region should be the color of the point on the picture that corresponds to the associated Voronoi point.  At any rate, what it comes down to is pretty pictures.  I've included the original and mosaic version for some of the pictures we were provided.

I've got others, but they are less than impressive.  If you've got a square picture that you'd like to see made into a mosaic in this way, and I like you, send it along.  Or, use any number of image editors.
