<p>There are a million services out there where you type in an IP address and get an estimate as to its location.  A few months ago I stumbled across a free IP geolocation database because I find myself using online services from time to time - I was sort of surprised how often it's helpful to know where traffic is coming from (outside of Google Analytics, etc.).</p>
<p>Using the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.iplocationtools.com&#47;sql_database.php">database<&#47;a> I found, I threw together a script that takes a list of domain names and &#47; or IP addresses and gives you an idea of where it lives:</p>
