  content: Once I get a few more features implemented (object refraction, octrees,
    fixed lathe normals, and world rotation &#47; translation), I'm going to make
    a clip (I'm thinking about 1-2 minutes in HD) that's a little more involved, and
    really shows some of the capabilities.  I do have a clip with reflections, which,
    when they work, are pretty realistic, but there are still some residual artifacts
    from erroneous normals.

<p>It occurred to me today that I could render a scene several times with slight perturbations and then mesh them together into a movie.  It took about 15 minutes to render on a cluster at Mines, and then about a minute to stitch together with Mencoder.  At 18 frames per second, here is the result.  Enjoy!</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;v&#47;mWT0UOBTT5Y&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6"><&#47;param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><&#47;param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><&#47;param><embed src="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;v&#47;mWT0UOBTT5Y&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6" type="application&#47;x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"><&#47;embed><&#47;object></p>
