A few days ago, I finally moved into what I'm told will be my permanent residence at KAUST.

I left the United States on August 16th making it almost two months of living out of a suitcase, sleeping in eight different beds in various places and cohabitating with a number of people.  It's far from perfect, but to have a home that will remain the same is enough for now.  About half of the possessions I brought with me had not left my suitcase for those two months.

I'm moving furniture around and cleaning this weekend, but I'm very excited to nest.  This may very well be where I live for the next several years of my life.

I'd post pictures, but the camera I got this summer (a Nikon D60) was stolen this week.  My backpack and headphones preceded it in disappearing, and so my friend Tyler and I will be setting up a hidden spy camera in our office to hopefully get some of our belongings back or at least catch some nefarious individuals as security staff has been less than helpful.
