<p>W&uuml;t for Leopard.</p>
<p>I've been enjoying the hell out of Apple's new OS - you can read about its awesomeness elsewhere.  I will express my surprise, however, that they are using a picture of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.wired.com&#47;gadgets&#47;2007&#47;10&#47;leopard-bsod-ic.html">Windows' BSOD<&#47;a> as the icon for network PCs.  So... smug.  I hope people are laughing about this as much as I am.</p>
<p>I was wary of the semi-transparent top bar, but the only thing I didn't like about it was Google Notifier's icon indicating that I have no unread mail.  It... used... white..., not... transparent.  I think you'll agree it looked awful:</p>
<p><a href='http:&#47;&#47;dan.lecocq.us&#47;wordpress&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2007&#47;10&#47;before.png' title='Before'><img src='http:&#47;&#47;dan.lecocq.us&#47;wordpress&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2007&#47;10&#47;before.png' alt='Before' &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>Much better after deleting the white bits and making them transparent:</p>
<p><a href='http:&#47;&#47;dan.lecocq.us&#47;wordpress&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2007&#47;10&#47;after.png' title='After'><img src='http:&#47;&#47;dan.lecocq.us&#47;wordpress&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2007&#47;10&#47;after.png' alt='After' &#47;><&#47;a></p>
