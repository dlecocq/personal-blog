  content: Are the tickets transferable? It seems that reddit has Colbert fever recently...and
    since half of its users are New Yorkers you could make someone very happy.

  content: It says explicitly that the person whose name is on the ticket must be
    present.  So... sadness!

<p>One of the joys I was hoping to experience here in New York City was to go to a filming of The Colbert Report.  Unfortunately, getting a ticket can be tricky.  There are rarely tickets available, and so you have to sign up to receive notifications when they become available.</p>
<p>If you do not constantly sit on your email, your chances of going are greatly diminished.  I've been trying for about a month, because as a computer scientist, I am often on my email and can usually respond pretty quickly (< 5 minutes).  Today... was my lucky day.  Sort of.</p>
<p>I responded within a minute of receiving a notification, and was pleased that today I had been fast enough.  There were still 40 tickets left!  By the time I had finished filling out the form, there were a mere 28 left.  I'm sure that in a couple of minutes the whole thing had closed off.  It would seem that Colbert's a popular guy.</p>
<p>So, here's the trouble... the filming is on August 23rd, about a week and a half after I leave the city, and mere days before returning to Saudi Arabia.  Just... my... luck.</p>
