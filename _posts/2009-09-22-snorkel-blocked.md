We were invited to go snorkeling in the Red Sea today.  The bus was to leave at 7 am, fifty seats, first-come first served.

We made it out to Jeddah, and then onto the boat, and around 8:30, we were on the water heading out to the reef.  It was supposed to be a two-hour trek each way, but we were perfectly comfortable on this 70-foot yacht.  Really pretty stunning accommodations.

Around 9:30, we were informed that the university had actually called us back for security reasons, and that security had just closed off the channel we were going to take out to the sea anyway.  Such is life.  The reason for the security issues here now through the next few days is the King.  Not only the king, but 60+ of his closest friends who rule countries.  All in, 3,500 very impressive and generally awesome people will be flocking to campus to open this school up.

I'd still like to get an invite to the event, and I was looking forward to trying my flippers at snorkeling, but if I'm going to be snorkel-blocked by anyone, I suppose there are worse reasons.
