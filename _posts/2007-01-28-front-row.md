This is Front Row - a little media center that ships with OS X that works wonderfully with the apple remote that comes with MacBooks, iMacs and Mac Minis.

The video is a little joggy, and that's a symptom of the screen capture tool, not the actual performance.  (I have the screen capture tool set to 10 fps as opposed to 30 or so.)
