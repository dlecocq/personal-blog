In the vein of relentless self-improvement, one of the neatest things I've come across lately is [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/).  It's a list of now 251 problems in math, programming, scripting and algorithms.  Sometimes the problems are more in the vein of what Doctor Who called "recreational mathematics:"

> Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

to more lexicographical things:

> If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?

At any rate, it's a really great set of problems and good programmatic and analytical practice.  Like [Problem 67](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=67) where the difference between a brute force attack and an efficient solution could easily be "over twenty billion years."
