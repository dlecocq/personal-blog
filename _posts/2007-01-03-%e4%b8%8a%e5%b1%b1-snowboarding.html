<p>I've been saying all break that I was going to go skiing&#47;snowboarding, but I'm actually going to be going tomorrow. Around 4:00 PM this afternoon, I called a friend and we made plans to spend the next couple of days in 山形 (Yamagata) skiing&#47;snowboarding.</p>
<p>It's about $150 US for transportation, a day of snowboarding with rentals, a hotel, another day of snowboarding, and then transportation back. I don't think that's too bad relative to the JASSO scholarship.</p>
<p>I feel like a total nerd, but I actually went online and read a tutorial on snowboarding before packing my backpack and getting some shut-eye. We leave for the train station in about four and a half hours, and we should be on the mountain by 9:30 or so. Exciting!</p>
<p>If I'm still alive, I will post pictures.</p>
