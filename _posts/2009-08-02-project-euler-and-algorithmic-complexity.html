<p>In the vein of relentless self-improvement, one of the neatest things I've come across lately is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;projecteuler.net&#47;">Project Euler<&#47;a>.  It's a list of now 251 problems in math, programming, scripting and algorithms.  Sometimes the problems are more in the vein of what Doctor Who called "recreational mathematics:"</p>
<blockquote><p>
Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand&#47;multiplier&#47;product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.<br />
<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>to more lexicographical things:</p>
<blockquote><p>
If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?<br />
<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>At any rate, it's a really great set of problems and good programmatic and analytical practice.  Like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;projecteuler.net&#47;index.php?section=problems&id=67">Problem 67<&#47;a> where the difference between a brute force attack and an efficient solution could easily be "over twenty billion years."</p>
