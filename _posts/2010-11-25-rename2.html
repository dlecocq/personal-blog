  content: 'That is cool stuff.  I had heard about about rename, but many have suggested
    to me piping the results of find to xargs over this method.  That way, you have
    a lot more fine grain control: recursive depth traversal, date&#47;time cutoffs,
    and even the beloved regex.'

<p>I found myself needing to systematically rename a bunch of files, and previously the only way I knew to do it was with a loop, passing each filename into sed, and using the output as the destination filename.  Tedious and error prone!</p>
<p>However, it turns out that people have anticipated this use case, and there is a utility for this exact purpose, called "rename."  It allows you to provide a perl-style regular expression whose input is the existing filename found by your search expression, and whose output is what that file should be renamed.  There's even an <em>especially useful option<&#47;em> to take no action, but only to print out what the new filenames would be, allowing you to perform a dry-run before you rename 100000 files.</p>
<p>Example:<br />
<code><br />
rename -n 's&#47;^&#47;some.file.prefix.&#47;' *.jpg<br />
<&#47;code></p>
<p>Happy renaming!</p>
