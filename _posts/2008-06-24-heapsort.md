I was reading about [Algorithm Geeks](http://groups.google.com/group/algogeeks), a Google Group dedicated to algorithm-related questions apparently.  I looked at one of the topics, [Unique Elements in an Array](http://groups.google.com/group/algogeeks/web/unique-elements-in-an-array), wondering what the chatter looked like.

To remove duplicate elements of an array, the best way I know is to sort your array, and then do a linear traversal, comparing each to its successor, and when they match, deleting the one of them.  Quicksort is generally the algorithm-of-choice in large part because of its simplicity, but someone on this thread suggested [heapsort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort) - an algorithm of which I had never heard.  I looked it over, and was drawn to the article on [heaps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap).  On that page, I was looking at an analysis of the time complexity for building the heap, and I got curious about the summation they present (h/2^h).  So, I took some time and proved its convergence:
