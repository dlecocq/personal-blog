<p>I've come out to the D.C. area for a workshop put on by the DOE, but that's not until this weekend.  In the mean time, I've been spending time with friends from high school (currently Michael in Annapolis, MD).</p>
<p>I got into town on the Fourth of July, and was fortunate enough to meet up with Michael and some friends before the fireworks.  I've only been here a couple of times, but still I've never seen it so crowded.  We got to watch from Pat's parents' boat, docked in the Potomac.  Thanks again, Diane and Bill!</p>

<p>We hung out, had some food and occupied ourselves with the overactive children.  (Actually, we got a little peace and quiet when I handed the troublesome trio a logic game on the iPhone - they got so absorbed in it they sat calmly for two hours!)</p>

<p>The fireworks started at a quarter past nine, but it was one of the weakest shows I've seen, though I've been spoiled by Mines' E-Days display (if you <em>ever<&#47;em> have the chance to see that event, it is <em>imperative<&#47;em> that you do so).</p>
