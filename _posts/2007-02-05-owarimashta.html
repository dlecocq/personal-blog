<p>Yes, yes, it's over.<br &#47;><br &#47;>This has been an interesting semester, and I've certainly learned a lot about myself and Japanese.  Also, about the Japanese.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Last night I began studying for my last final (Kanji), by trying to learn about 100 kanji that were going to be on the test.  It is virtually impossible to learn that many kanji in that amount of time (trying to double my kanji vocabulary overnight), but I had to try.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Test today, went alright.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Got a shirt I ordered in the mail:<br &#47;><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http:&#47;&#47;bp0.blogger.com&#47;_pFuEsHQdbuM&#47;Rcbu_eInunI&#47;AAAAAAAAAAM&#47;rBfjcui4Jkc&#47;s1600-h&#47;Photo+100.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http:&#47;&#47;bp0.blogger.com&#47;_pFuEsHQdbuM&#47;Rcbu_eInunI&#47;AAAAAAAAAAM&#47;rBfjcui4Jkc&#47;s320&#47;Photo+100.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5027968808194128498" &#47;><&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;>Lastly, heading to Sapporo in a few days for the Snow Festival.  When I feel more energetic&#47;alive, I will say more.  In the mean time, please enjoy this wonderful show called "<a href='http:&#47;&#47;www.dudershow.com&#47;'>Duders<&#47;a>."  It's a little rough, but I think it could be&#47;will be good.</p>
