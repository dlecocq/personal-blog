I recently wrote a new [dev blog post](http://devblog.seomoz.org/2012/05/introducing-qless-our-new-job-queue/) at SEOmoz about [qless](https://github.com/seomoz/qless), a project I've been working on. It's a queueing system that takes advantage of Redis 2.6's server-side Lua scripting.

Happy queueing!
