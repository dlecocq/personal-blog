<p>After a series of long flights, we finally arrived at Jeddah International Airport.  A little trouble at immigration, but nothing that prevented me from entering the country.</p>
<p>We make our way through a sea of women in burkhas and men in thawbs onto a bus that's headed to our hotel.  A kid who is from Jeddah but was studying abroad in the States was pointing out sights along the way.  Mostly dreary nods and acknowledging the presence of this or that.</p>
<p>Happy to see the hotel, we entered a gate surrounded by concrete blockades, with Steyr-AUG-assault-rifle-bearing soldiers.  Nearby another guard is perched atop a Hummer, clutching his mounted machine gun.  Not unexpected, but still a little surprising.</p>
<p>We enter the hotel which stuns from the moment you first see it.  Marble everything, and 6 great glass elevators.  The registration desk hands us our schedules, badges, and even SIM cards so we can get local cell phone service while we're here.  (Unfortunately it's not a network that Apple will willingly support, but we have ways.)  In the rooms, they have marbled wood furniture, and a beautiful patio.  I actually feel a little guilty about staying in such a nice place.  Photos to come.</p>
