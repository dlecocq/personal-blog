This is our first assignment (due this coming Wednesday), and seems relatively appropriate.  I'll let [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionaries_and_cannibals_problem) give you background.

I pounded it out in about 10-20 minutes in Ruby, and seems like a good chance for me to refresh my Dr. Scheme (it's been about a year, except for a pop quiz from Matt Matteson).  Although it's really not a difficult problem to solve nor that much of a feat to code for it, I really enjoy the simplicity of the solution.  It reminded me a lot of a really elegant solution to the [Tower Of Hanoi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) problem that Prof. Rader showed us in Data Structures.

Additionally, it's always fun to take first steps in a buzz-word-titled class: Artificial Intelligence.
