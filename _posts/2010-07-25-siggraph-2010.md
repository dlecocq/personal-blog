I arrived in Los Angeles yesterday to attend (and talk at) SIGGRAPH 2010.  This is not the first time the conference has been here, but it is certainly my first time to this smoggy city.

Adjacent to the Los Angeles Convention Center is the Staples Center, where workers have been setting up for the X Games.  Fortunately they won't begin until July 29th, the last day of this conference, but in watching the setup I was imagining an enormous re-enactment of high school stereotypes.  Tens of thousands of jocks right next door to tens of thousands of nerds.
