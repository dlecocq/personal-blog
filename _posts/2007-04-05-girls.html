<p>"Language."<br &#47;>"I'm sorry?"<br &#47;>"Eh, language? Learn?"<br &#47;>"You want to learn Japanese?"<br &#47;>"Eh, yes."<br &#47;><br &#47;>A sketchy-looking Russian man stopped Alan and me while I was picking him up from the train station.<br &#47;><br &#47;>"Are you needing a translator? Or do you want to learn Japanese?"<br &#47;>"Eh, my ship, I want make more money. Eh, Japanese."<br &#47;><br &#47;>There are quite a few Russian sailors in Japan, especially in the port cities (and Sendai is a fairly large port city).  In some places I've seen (like in Otaru), signs appear only in Japanese and Russian - not Japanese and English.  I hadn't met any Russian sailors, but it didn't surprise me to see one.<br &#47;><br &#47;>"I'm not exactly sure where you can learn Japanese."<br &#47;>"Girls."<br &#47;>"Excuse me?"<br &#47;>"Alcohol.  I want meet girls."<br &#47;><br &#47;>I point towards 国分町 (Kokubunchou), the big night-life scene.  He thanks us and is on his way.  Crazy Russians.</p>
