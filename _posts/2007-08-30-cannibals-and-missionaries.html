  content: "I don't know if you ever picked it up, but you did receive an A on your
    pop quiz. \r\n\r\nBe prepared, I will never tell you beforehand what topic or
    time the next quiz will be presented. :)"

<p>This is our first assignment (due this coming Wednesday), and seems relatively appropriate.  I'll let <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Missionaries_and_cannibals_problem">Wikipedia<&#47;a> give you background.</p>
<p>I pounded it out in about 10-20 minutes in Ruby, and seems like a good chance for me to refresh my Dr. Scheme (it's been about a year, except for a pop quiz from Matt Matteson).  Although it's really not a difficult problem to solve nor that much of a feat to code for it, I really enjoy the simplicity of the solution.  It reminded me a lot of a really elegant solution to the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Tower_of_Hanoi">Tower Of Hanoi<&#47;a> problem that Prof. Rader showed us in Data Structures.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's always fun to take first steps in a buzz-word-titled class: Artificial Intelligence.</p>
