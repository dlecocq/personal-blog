<p>It's CSM's census day today, which usually means one thing for me: changing classes at the last minute.  Sixteen credits turned into fifteen (I really don't want to take Senior Seminar).  I wanted to take Database Management, but the professor left Mines, and the class was cancelled.  Next on to my next choice Compiler Design (I've been wanting this class since I took Principles of Programming Languages, and it's only offered once a year.  You get to write your own Java compiler!  How awesome is that?</p>
<p>I would really like to make it out of Mines in a timely fashion, and I'll have some graduate school requirements, so... on to the next really enticing class: CSCI562 Applied Algorithms and Data Structures.  One of my favorite classes was CSCI406 Algorithms, and Dr. Mehta is teaching this one as well.</p>
<p>I hadn't turned in my grad school application when it was due, so I was planning on starting my grad work this spring.  As it turns out, there's a mechanism for allowing undergrads to take graduate courses.  Unfortunately only seniors are allowed to, and from my first two years at Mines, I had only 88 credits (two credits shy of seniorhood).  My transfer credit from my year abroad hasn't come in yet (all up to 12 credits of it).  A signature from the prof of the course, my advisor and the man in charge of grad school, and I'm in the class!</p>
<p>My first graduate class!  In the of the l337, "w00t."</p>
