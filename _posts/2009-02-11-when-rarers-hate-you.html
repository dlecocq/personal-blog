<p>There are few things that I absolutely loathe more in coding than when someone rars a set of files instead of a folder.  It's as if they're saying, "whatever you had in this folder is completely worthless, and I'm going to dump 1000 byzantine files here for your to sift through.  Oh, and have a nice day."</p>
