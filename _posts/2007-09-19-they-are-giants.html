<p>I've only been waiting since the tenth grade to see They Might Be Giants.&nbsp; Every time I've wanted to see them when they come to Boulder, it's been a 21+ show.&nbsp; But this time, something is different.</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; I'm not 21.&nbsp; It's a 14+ show.</p>
<p>Tomorrow (Thursday), Boulder Theater.</p>
<p>Alan and I are going to rock our faces out and then get ready to atone, 'cause Yom Kippur starts on Friday night.</p>
<p>w00t</p>
