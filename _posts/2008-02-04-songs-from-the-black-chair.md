A couple of weeks ago, I read about Charles Barber's new book, _Comfortably Numb_ in [Wired](http://www.wired.com/culture/culturereviews/magazine/16-02/pl_print), and it sounded intensely interesting.  It's due to come out this month, and I've reserved one of the first copies to come into Golden Public Library.

At any rate, I decided to pursue his other book, _Songs From The Black Chair_.  Honestly, when I found (in the prologue) that this was a reference to Tears For Fear's _Songs From The Big Chair_, I was turned off, but perhaps in the end it was relatively appropriate.  Still, I felt like it was a stretch.

In terms of the meat of the book, rarely in my "adult life" have I been so floored by a book.  I got the book last week, and read the prologue on Thursday night, but finished the rest of it on Sunday and today.  When class let out this afternoon, I wasn't thinking of coming home, having a beer and watching a TV show before starting homework.  Instead, I was set on finishing up the home stretch of this book.  The last time I read a book so quickly (for me, this is very fast) was Kurt Vonnegut's _Slaughterhouse-Five_.  (I reread it for a scholarship essay I wrote; incidentally, I didn't win the moneys.)

Reading this book was like reading about my friend and myself.  At first, to the point that I felt completely and utterly involved, and then so much that it was eerie, and then at last to the point that I almost felt indignant about being very eloquently how I felt.  I can't very well articulate how much its reading has affected me.

Oddly enough, at certain points it made me give more credence to the whole anarchist nihilistic punk thing - a "thing" I always regarded as, well, silly.  That's certainly not to say I don't love Fight Club or SLC Punk, but like Stevo said, he had given no thought to the future, and when the world didn't end, he had to grow up.
