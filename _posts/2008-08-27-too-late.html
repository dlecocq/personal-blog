  content: "Try the basics. No big meal before bed, stay away from glowing screens,
    no caffeine. I've also heard to only sleep in bed, don't read or compute or watch
    TV or listen to radio, as your body can tie the simple fact that you go to this
    bed to sleep. Get some exercise in, perhaps you can just jog home or something
    so you don't have to find more time in your day.\r\n\r\nJust some ideas, I hope
    things get better."

<p>After tossing and turning in bed for what turned out to be three hours of not being able to sleep, I decided to get on my computer and get some reading done.  Seriously, my RSS client's inbox has been around 700 for a couple of days now.  Sure, I just clicked "mark as read" for a lot of it, but I did get through a serious chunk:</p>
<p><a href='http:&#47;&#47;dan.lecocq.us&#47;wordpress&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2008&#47;08&#47;picture-9.png' title='No New Items'><img src='http:&#47;&#47;dan.lecocq.us&#47;wordpress&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2008&#47;08&#47;picture-9.thumbnail.png' alt='No New Items' &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>I remember that around 1 o'clock, I listened to Elliott Smith's "2:45 AM" and hoped it wouldn't come to that.</p>
<p>Tips for getting to sleep?  Leave 'em in the comments.  No meds though.  I kicked my Ambien habit.</p>
