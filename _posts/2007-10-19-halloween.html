<p>I don't think I'm alone in not having "done" Halloween since the 6th grade, but I find myself wondering if I'm too old to get candy from strangers.</p>
<p>Either way, I've decided to party up this October 31st nerdy-style.  Gonna find &#47; make myself some steampunk goggles and pick up a lab coat.  I've been <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.evilmadscientist.com&#47;article.php&#47;LEDMinifigs">carving up LEGO mans<&#47;a> and ordered a couple of bags of LEDs for them.  If I feel particularly festive, I might try to carve <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.evilmadscientist.com&#47;article.php&#47;DalekPumpkin">a Dalek<&#47;a>.</p>
