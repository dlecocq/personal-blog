I know what I've said that I would be making the switch to Apple, but I made that leap today when my brand new MacBook arrived at my doorstep. I got my case in the mail about a week ago, and I assumed the computer would arrive in a similar fashion (a note in my mailbox would tell me I received a package and to please pick it up). Apple told me it would be here on or before the 18th, but my case got here the day after it shipped, so I had been hoping.

After checking my mailbox, I returned to my apartment somewhat disappointed, but looking forward to Monday. A few hours, a knock on my door and a signature later, I was ready to make the switch. I have since spent the last (too many) hours installing my favorite software and setting preferences and whatnot. (You see, this isn't really my mac switch per se - this last year I started using the schools Macs for my programming needs and was blown away. School ended, no more Mac - what's a boy to do?)
