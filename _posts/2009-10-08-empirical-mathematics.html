<p>As I read in a lecture recently, Richard Hamming described his philosophy of computing with, "the purpose of computing is insight, not numbers."</p>
<p>On a relatively regular basis, I use numerical methods to verify an analytical solution I've reached and occasionally, to reach an analytical result.  At <a href="http:&#47;&#47;dan.lecocq.us&#47;wordpress&#47;2008&#47;06&#47;24&#47;heapsort&#47;">one point<&#47;a>, I was playing around with the time complexity of heapsort, and I came across a statement about which I was unsure.  I verified that it was the case, but it brought about other questions about a more general case.</p>
<p>$$\sum_{h=0}^{\infty}{\frac{h}{n^h}}$$</p>
<p>How does this converge for different $$n$$'s?</p>
<p>I played around with it for a little bit to see if I saw any pattern that emerged, like with a geometric series or an arithmetic sum, but I came up with nothing.  So, I decided to explore the numbers a little bit, writing a short little Ruby script to take the first 100-or-so elements.  It turns out that even this approximation provided the insight to get the general expression:</p>
<ul>
<li>$$n=2 \Rightarrow 2$$<&#47;li>
<li>$$n=3 \Rightarrow 0.75 = \frac{3}{4}$$<&#47;li>
<li>$$n=4 \Rightarrow 0.4444... = \frac{4}{9}$$<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<p>The expression thus seemed to be:</p>
<p>$$\sum_{h=0}^{\infty}{\frac{h}{n^h}} = \frac{n}{(n-1)^2}$$</p>
<p>Of course this needed to be verified, but that task is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;dan.lecocq.us&#47;wordpress&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2008&#47;06&#47;heap.pdf">easy enough<&#47;a>.  The point is, that sometimes the numerical approximation can give you the exploratory insight needed to solve a problem.  Sure, it's rough around the edges, and isn't as elegant as I would necessarily like, but it's very useful.</p>
