<p>During my time in Japan, I picked up a new habit - smoking.  I would let myself have on cigarette per day, and I would save it until the evening.  I would sit out on my tanning chair with a cigarette, a Kurt Vonnegut book and "Cafe au lait," and just enjoy the quiet Japanese evening.  The crackling of the cigarette and slowly burning ember are among the things I enjoyed most.  As I write this, even, I'm enjoying a clove cigarette.  I just accidentally ashed on the floor.  Oops.  Apparently for the crackling of cigarettes in movies, they use cloves because they're so much louder.  A film-major friend of mine said that the mics can't pick up that of a normal cigarette.  Clove smoke is so much thicker, too.  It rises up like a beautiful plume.  The taste is toxic.  Somehow I've always found it satisfying.  It's like breathing poison.  Fill my lungs. </p>
