<p>A couple of weeks ago, I read about Charles Barber's new book, <em>Comfortably Numb<&#47;em> in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.wired.com&#47;culture&#47;culturereviews&#47;magazine&#47;16-02&#47;pl_print">Wired<&#47;a>, and it sounded intensely interesting.  It's due to come out this month, and I've reserved one of the first copies to come into Golden Public Library.</p>
<p>At any rate, I decided to pursue his other book, <em>Songs From The Black Chair<&#47;em>.  Honestly, when I found (in the prologue) that this was a reference to Tears For Fear's <em>Songs From The Big Chair<&#47;em>, I was turned off, but perhaps in the end it was relatively appropriate.  Still, I felt like it was a stretch.</p>
<p>In terms of the meat of the book, rarely in my "adult life" have I been so floored by a book.  I got the book last week, and read the prologue on Thursday night, but finished the rest of it on Sunday and today.  When class let out this afternoon, I wasn't thinking of coming home, having a beer and watching a TV show before starting homework.  Instead, I was set on finishing up the home stretch of this book.  The last time I read a book so quickly (for me, this is very fast) was Kurt Vonnegut's <em>Slaughterhouse-Five<&#47;em>.  (I reread it for a scholarship essay I wrote; incidentally, I didn't win the moneys.)</p>
<p>Reading this book was like reading about my friend and myself.  At first, to the point that I felt completely and utterly involved, and then so much that it was eerie, and then at last to the point that I almost felt indignant about being very eloquently how I felt.  I can't very well articulate how much its reading has affected me.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, at certain points it made me give more credence to the whole anarchist nihilistic punk thing - a "thing" I always regarded as, well, silly.  That's certainly not to say I don't love Fight Club or SLC Punk, but like Stevo said, he had given no thought to the future, and when the world didn't end, he had to grow up.</p>
