<p>For Scientific Computing, I decided I wanted to have a grapher with which I could programmatically interface easily.  Of course, there are options other there, from gnuPlot to you-name-it, but I figured that it wouldn't be too hard to write one myself.  Especially since there's a ruby port for OpenGL.</p>
<p>Long story short, I've got something that's not too terrible.  Not perfect, but it's certainly a start:<br />

<p>But then, I thought, "why stop there?"  I figured it wouldn't be that hard to make a 3D version.  While the 2D one will work on any generic function you give it, this 3D one has it hard-coded in right now.  Of course, it wouldn't be too much more to make it more flexible, but given that this took 30 minutes, I'm ok with its rigidity.<br />

<p>We'll see where this goes.  It makes me feel a little nerdy that I'm two days into my winter break, and this is how I've spent some of it.</p>
