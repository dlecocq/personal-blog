<p>A little game I play with myself sometimes that's somewhat along the lines of Desert Island is this (I don't have a name for it): If you suddenly found yourself way back in time, what would you bring (intellectually, academically) back from modern times?</p>
<p>Try it for different time periods.  For example, if it were 5000 B.C., would you, say, know how to smelt?  I guess I try to put things in the context of the big ideas &#47; advances of the time.</p>
<p>If it were the 1400's, could you demonstrate that the earth was round?  If it were the 1700's or so, could you explain <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Maxwell%27s_equations">Maxwell's equations<&#47;a>?  Late 1800's - relativity?  Quantum mechanics?  Wave-particle duality?</p>
<p>This sometimes makes me wish I knew how to smelt.</p>
