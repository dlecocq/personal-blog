<p>Nagano (well, Yudanaka) is famous for it's "Monkey Park," an open space where <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Japanese_macaque">Japanese Macaque<&#47;a>s relax in large groups in the natural hot springs.  Visitors can walk among them as they graze, groom, and occasionally, fight.</p>

<p>The younger monkeys are pretty playful, climbing ropes and poles, and rough-housing with one another.  The adult monkeys seem more interested in eating the food provided to them, a mix of barley and other grains.  There seemed to be some areas used mostly by families (these were inaccessible to human visitors) and others that seemed to be dominated by younger bachelors.  Fights would break out from time to time, but nothing too serious.</p>

<p>Japan is known for their natural hot springs, and the monkeys take full advantage.  The day I was there, it was about 3 degrees Celsius, and the water was pretty tempting.</p>
<p>You can get pretty close to these brazen animals, but do not touch.  Occasionally they will grab onto you, but I only saw one instance of this; a group of us were watching a couple monkeys playing and banging against a sign, when an attention-starved lad came up and tugged on one man's coat to get his attention.  Still, they're pretty aloof to our presence for the most part, and will walk and eat within a few feet of you.</p>

<p>I kept thinking of them as terrestrial Ewoks, or furry seven-year-old human children, but the opposable toes are kind of unnerving.  They often appear so human that it's hard to remember that they're still very wild.</p>

<p>They cry and scream at one another, but these noises serve as low-priority warnings more than anything else.</p>
<p>If you even get a chance to visit, take full advantage.  Best US$5 I spent in Japan.  More photos on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.flickr.com&#47;photos&#47;danlecocq&#47;sets&#47;72157623077596510&#47;">flickr<&#47;a>.</p>
