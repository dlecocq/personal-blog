<p>I've been putting together a media server for my newly-hacked <a href="http:&#47;&#47;dan.lecocq.us&#47;wordpress&#47;2007&#47;09&#47;24&#47;xbmc&#47;">XBox media center<&#47;a>, and I had an old 120 gig hard drive laying around that wasn't seeing much use.  I thought I'd throw it in the box, giving me 240 gigs total to keep online for my viewing pleasure.  The problem was, however, that I had removed the shunt at some point, and couldn't find one around the house (who keeps these, anyway)?  So, presenting my very ghetto make-shift shunt:</p>
<p><a href='http:&#47;&#47;dan.lecocq.us&#47;wordpress&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2007&#47;09&#47;sany0050.png' title='Ghetto Shunt'><img style="float:left;margin:5px" src='http:&#47;&#47;dan.lecocq.us&#47;wordpress&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2007&#47;09&#47;sany0050.thumbnail.png' alt='Ghetto Shunt' &#47;><&#47;a>Made from one of those yellow connectors (if you know the name of what I'm talking about, please let me know), I snapped off the part where you put the wire in and then clamp it with pliers.  Before using that, I made sure I had the right setting (I wanted this one as the slave HD), by touching a screwdriver to the two pins associated with that setting and held it there as I booted the machine.  Probably a safe&#47;smart move (but in all reality, how much current flows through those pins, anyway?).</p>
