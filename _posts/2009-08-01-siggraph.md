I arrived in New Orleans yesterday, showed up on the doorstep of the wrong hotel and then promptly found the right one.

Today sees the start of the co-located events (I'm going to NPAR - Non-Photorealistic Animation and Rendering), and I'm so psyched!  If you're at SIGGRAPH or in New Orleans and want to hang out and network, drop me an email / comment!

Woohoo! SIGGRAPH!
