There's a guy who's perpetually in alamode (the lab of choice for the C.S. major of discerning taste) named Feineman.  It was through him that I found [failblog](http://failblog.org/) - he was tearing through the archive and it had some pretty funny stuff.

Yesterday he found yet another gem.  Apparently there's a mutex (mutual exclusion) on sex and studying engineering:
