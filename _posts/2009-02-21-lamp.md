  content: It reminds me a bit of a Piet Mondrian painting...although without the
    colors. Very well done though.

I made a lamp this weekend for Rachel as a belated Valentine's Day gift.  Made from balsa wood, vellum, hot glue and the electrical components, I got my inspiration from [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/5-Japanese-lamp-from-recycled-materials/).  It didn't look well put-together, and so I made my own interpretation:

![img_0244]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/2009/02/img_0244.jpg)
![img_0248]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/2009/02/img_0248.jpg)
