Matt Matteson had a homework problem dealing with (n+a)^b, and finding a bound for it.  Expanding this and evaluating it at n=a piqued my curiosity about the sum of each of the binomial expansion terms.  That is to say, the sum of `bC0 + bC1 + ... + bCb`.  Well, I explored it a little bit, and did a quick-and-dirty writeup of my findings:
