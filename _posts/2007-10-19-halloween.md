I don't think I'm alone in not having "done" Halloween since the 6th grade, but I find myself wondering if I'm too old to get candy from strangers.

Either way, I've decided to party up this October 31st nerdy-style.  Gonna find / make myself some steampunk goggles and pick up a lab coat.  I've been [carving up LEGO mans](http://www.evilmadscientist.com/article.php/LEDMinifigs) and ordered a couple of bags of LEDs for them.  If I feel particularly festive, I might try to carve [a Dalek](http://www.evilmadscientist.com/article.php/DalekPumpkin).
