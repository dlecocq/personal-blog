<p>Two days ago I finished my final for Scientific Computing (it was a take-home final), and was somewhat sad to see the end of it.  Sure, it was a lot of work (too much, according to Matt Matteson) - I spent literally upwards of a hundred hours this semester working on the homework and exams.  I recently tallied up the number of pages I submitted, and it was upwards of a 135 8.5 x 11 pages, most of it marked up in LaTeX.  (Because of this class my LaTeX-fu has grown significantly stronger.)</p>
<p>I look forward to any more classes I have with this prof.</p>
