<p>My numerical linear algebra professor is sponsoring me to join him at SIGGRAPH Asia this year in Yokohama, which conveniently affords me the opportunity to return to Japan.</p>
<p>I went to SIGGRAPH for the first time this year, and am really excited to get a chance to go to another, especially in Japan.  Thanks to Mrs. Redman, who arranged my flight.  I'll arrive about a day early, and then I've got about a week to myself after it.  I'm planning to take full advantage of the snow, going to Nagano for five of those days - just booked the hotel.</p>
<p>I left Japan a few years ago not eager to return, but I've been feeling very nostalgic for it lately.  And hey, it will be my second Christmas there!</p>
