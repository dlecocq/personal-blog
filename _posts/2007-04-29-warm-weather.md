We've finally gotten into the warm weather here in Sendai, with up to 21 C (70 F).  I bought a lawn chair and enjoyed my first chance to stretch out on my porch with a beer in hand.  I could get used to sunlight.

I bought a video camera that I'm excited to use.  This means that friends and family will actually see some pictures when I get back (if you're lucky!), so look forward to it.  Hopefully it won't be boring vacation clips.

It turns out, I've listened to approximately 26 days of music in iTunes since I bought my Mac in December.  That's roughly 1/5th my life listening to iTunes.  I find this relatively surprising.
