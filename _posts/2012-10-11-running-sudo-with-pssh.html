  content: Well, the best I can think of is ssh's -S option, which will read a password
    from stdin. That said, it's also not a very secure option, but one that's available.

<p>The <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.theether.org&#47;pssh&#47;" title="pssh" target="_blank">pssh<&#47;a> tool is great. Just great. At SEOmoz we use a number of deployment schemes, but every so often I find myself needing to log into 50 machines and perform some simple one-off command. I've written such a line many times:<br />
<code><br />
for i in {01..05}; do ssh -t ec2-user@some-host-$i 'sudo ...'; done<br />
<&#47;code></p>
<p>This is fine if the command is quick, but it <em>really<&#47;em> sucks if it's something that takes more than just a few seconds. So in the absence of needing to use sudo (and thus the '-t' flag), pssh makes it easy to run these all in parallel:<br />
<code><br />
pssh -i --host=some-host-{01..50} -l ec2-user 'hostname'<br />
<&#47;code></p>
<p>Coercing pssh to create a pseudo-tty to enable sudo commands was a little tricky, though:<br />
<code><br />
# And now I can sudo!<br />
pssh -x '-t -t' -i --host=some-host-{01..50} -l ec2-user 'sudo hostname'<br />
<&#47;code></p>
