I had to give a talk on complexity theory and NP-completeness, and a friend suggested that I record it and post it for all the children of the world to enjoy.  Well, something like that.

I apologize for my verbal ticks - had I recorded myself beforehand and listened to it, I might have made an effort to correct them. I make a few mistakes, but overall, I think there have been worse talks. Enjoy. [View on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=gyExNNGSEgM)
