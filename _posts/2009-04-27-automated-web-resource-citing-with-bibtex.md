  content: Wow.  This is most cool.  I have recently come to accept my OS X reality
    for the time being, poking my own Linux-loving eye out.  This is a fun little
    tool that makes LaTeX go a long way.  Thanks for the tip.

I find myself constantly citing web resources that I need to cite, and I think it's a huge hassle.  They've all got the same format, and though Bibtex does a lot of the formatting heavy lifting for you, it's still a pain.

Enter laziness.

From Safari, I drag a web location onto my desktop, or keep them in a references folder:

![Drag a link onto the desktop from Safari.]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/2009/04/2.png)

And then drag the web location onto the droplet to get results.  You can drag several files or folders on at once:

![Rejoice in the output.]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/2009/04/3.png)

![Running on a directory.]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/2009/04/4.png)

Or from the command line tool (see the install tool):

![Using it from the command line.]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/2009/04/command.png)

Installation:

![Disk image contents]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/2009/04/contents1.png)

Files:

[webdoc-0.1]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/2009/04/webdoc.tar)
