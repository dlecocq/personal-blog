<p>Tonight I saw Shireen, and in fact, it's just now that I'm returning.  I'm so completely infatuated with her, and we've spent many nights in the last couple of weeks cuddling and kissing softly.  She told me tonight that kissing me is like Chocolate Milk - warm, sweet, and makes her feel tingly.  She's so sweet.</p>
<p>I told her that kissing her fills me with pride and awe and makes me feel very flattered that such a wonderful girl and beautiful creature would kiss me.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I told her that I had a crush on her.  I actually told her twice - the first time when more than a little drunk, and the next night I told her as I had intended.  A couple days afterwards, she informed me that she liked me, as well.  I paused, and apparently looked expressionless for a few seconds, which lead her to briefly think that she had said something wrong, but then I said, "I'm ecstatic!  This really makes my night."  I had just walked her to her car, and she about to be on her way home.  I wished her a good night, and walked off, but even then I wish I had kissed her.  She was already seated in her car, so it probably would have been awkward, but all the same, it just would have been the perfect flourish to wonderful news.</p>
<p>Since, we've spent probably 7 of 9 evenings together, holding each other, watching movies, and just generally twitterpated.  What a lovely girl.</p>
